## Listingslab Recruitment Test


Technical tests have become a part of the modern recruitment process for good reason. They give a far better idea of a candidate's suitability than a verbal interview alone.

As a rule, we enjoy taking these tests, especially if they are well designed, but it's often a one way street. We are generally being asked to show our whole hand without being shown theirs.

To redress that balance, we invite you to take the following test. It's a test of process and expectations. It should take no more than 2 bursts of 10 minutes work to produce a satisfactory answer.
